It’s a way to move through a subset (window) of elements in a linear structure (like arrays or strings),
adjusting the start and end of the window dynamically based on the problem's constraints.

We use it because it avoids unnecessary repeated work and turns an O(n²) brute-force approach into an O(n) efficient one.
